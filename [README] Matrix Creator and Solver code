constraints:
1. The destination row should be between 1/2 number of rows and the total number of rows.
2. The destination column should be a value between 2/3 number of columns and the total number of columns. 


RUNNING :
The code takes user input to create a matrix with obstacles while making sure the vlues being input meet the constraints set by the admin.
It will then ask to set the start point and the destination point. The matrix will show 0 in place of free cell and 1 in place of a blocked cell. 
Recursive grassfire algorithm will then find the route and display the cell number the robot will follow and then display the matrix with the full path.
